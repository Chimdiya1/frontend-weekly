# What is Cors



The hosts take us through what CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is and how it comes to play when developing web applications. CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin.

To understand CORS and the reason for it, you need to understand Same Origin Policy(SOP) which is a policy that is used to tackle Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and the hosts do well to explain this and a host of other topics surrounding CORS.

What youâ€™ll learn:
- What CORS is
- Reasons for CORS
- Same Origin Policy(SOP) and Origins 
- Kinds of requests
- How to implement CORS and more!!
